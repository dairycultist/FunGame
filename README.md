# New Hand in Mootown

[Itch.io page](https://dairycultist.itch.io/new-hand-in-mootown)

In order to combat depression, I'm making a game that's fun (and imperfect).

## Notes

**The moo moos run the shops. they are just 2D textures like paper mario, instead
of full, cumbersome, 3D models. the game should come out at some point, OK?**

Inspired by Slime Rancher, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, etc.

Farming game, with low poly cowgals, crops, customization, and cozy vibe.

World is pre-hand-crafted with pre-determined regions for garden plots and stuff.

Tiny game about farming in Mootown. Moo moos live in houses all around, whom
you can talk to and help out like Animal Crossing (if you can find where their
houses are!).

**Moo moo requests:**
Every product (crops, milk, and moo moos) can be sold for a base rate, but
moo moos will often request you feed them a certain amount of a certain crop,
rewarding you with bottles of their own milk which sells for much more than
the crops they ate. Thus, even if a crop is no longer viable for selling,
you'll still want to farm it when a moo moo is requesting it! Performing
these requests improves your friendship with the moo moo, and once you've
fully befriended a moo moo you can go inside their (uniquely designed!)
house like in Stardew Valley.

dialogue system

Most interactions occur by picking up objects and bumping them into other
objects. For example, a bag of 10 carrots seeds being placed onto an empty
garden plot will plant a carrot in the plot, removing one seed from the bag.

You can purchase a gate key which allows you to unlock more land. This either
is simply to get more farm plots, or unlock new regions with different terrain,
crops (via local shops), and moo moos.
Unlocking new areas lets you access more houses, and thus meet new moo moos.

TODO: simple starting-area map. slightly uneven terrain, a house, walls surrounding
it all (bar a closed gate you can't really see through) and paths (slightly raised
mesh of a repeating path texture with transparent edges so it's not part of the
ground itself). no need to make beyond this for now

3 mesh system: 1 visible, 1 collision, 1 grass placement

paths are gonna have a spritesheet texture (straight, end, T, idk)

add onion and potato and that's probably good enough for the demo
