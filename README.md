# FunGame

In order to combat depression, I'm making a game that's fun (even if it's not perfect). It's a farming game, with low poly crops, customization, and cozy animal crossing vibe.

I think play region will be... fenced off?

structures, like square or hexagonal platforms?

## Plan

- inventory that has trowel and seed bags. trowel can place/break dirt patches depending on whether you're hovering on the ground or an existing plot (they're allowed to slightly overlap because their collider is slightly smaller than their mesh, letting you make cute rows).

- garden box that you put items into to ship them off in exchange for a bag of currency. you can also put bags of currency in the garden box to 'combine them' by exchanging them for a single bag. the bag of currency is a physical item that you must bring to the shop to buy with.
