# FunGame

In order to combat depression, I'm making a game that's fun (even if it's not perfect). It's a farming game, with low poly crops, customization, and cozy animal crossing vibe.

plan: inventory that has trowel and seed bags. trowel can place/break dirt patches depending on whether you're hovering on the ground or an existing plot (they're allowed to slightly overlap because their collider is slightly smaller than their mesh, letting you make cute rows)

I think play region will be... fenced off?

structures, like square or hexagonal platforms?
