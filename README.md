# New Hand in Mootown

[Itch.io page](https://dairycultist.itch.io/new-hand-in-mootown)

In order to combat depression, I'm making a game that's fun (and imperfect).
The game should come out at some point, OK? So manage the scope, OK?

## Notes

todo:
1) finish starting area map (maybe some exploration area?) (slightly uneven terrain, a few tiny houses on stilts for you and the moo moos, closed gate)
2) draw Jess (and maybe another exploring moo moo)
3) dialogue system + requests
4) gate key (as part of a request reward!) + end of demo screen

maybe instead of requests it's just "find out a moo moo's favourite food
through dialogue, feed them enough til they're chonky, and ur done with them +
you get a reward)

Inspired by Slime Rancher, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, etc.

Farming game, with low poly cowgals, crops, customization, and cozy vibe.

World is pre-hand-crafted with pre-determined regions for garden plots and stuff.

Tiny game about farming in Mootown. Moo moos are all around -- running the shops
or running errands -- whom you can talk to and help out like Animal Crossing
(if you can find them!).

The moo moos run the shops. they are just 2D textures like paper mario, instead
of full, cumbersome, 3D models.

**Moo moo requests:**
sell crops at the attending shopkeep, or buy seeds from her crate. selling crops
the shopkeep is requesting (so she can eat them) gives double price, and reaching
the request goal comes with a gift (usually bottles of their own milk). this
encourages farming crops that may not otherwise be economically viable. performing
these requests makes the moo moos visually chonkier and improves your friendship
with the moo moo (as evident in new dialogue).

dialogue system

Most interactions occur by picking up objects and bumping them into other
objects. For example, a bag of 10 carrots seeds being placed onto an empty
garden plot will plant a carrot in the plot, removing one seed from the bag.

You can purchase a gate key which allows you to unlock more land. This either
is simply to get more farm plots, or unlock new regions with different terrain,
crops (via local shops), and moo moos.
Unlocking new areas lets you access more houses, and thus meet new moo moos.

3 mesh system: 1 visible, 1 collision, 1 grass placement

paths are gonna have a spritesheet texture (straight, end, T, idk)

crop ideas:
- onion (twinion, grows two in one plot? yellow and red?)
- potato
- cabbagecake (cabbage, but it's a cupcake)
