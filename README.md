# FunGame

In order to combat depression, I'm making a game that's fun (even if it's not perfect). It's a ranching/farming game, with low poly cowgals, crops, customization, and cozy animal crossing vibe.

world is pre-hand-crafted, like slime rancher, with pre-determined regions for garden plots and stuff

Tiny game about ranching moo moos. Different breeds have different max weights,
favourite foods, amount of food necessary to become full, and amount of milk
bottles produced upon becoming full. Feeding is only necessarily for getting
milk (they sustain themselves off grass) and increasing their weight. Moo moos
closer to max weight will sell for more. Each moo moo takes up one pen, which
you have a limited amount of, so you can sell them to clear up space. Thus, if
you get particularly attached to some of your moo moos, you can keep them around
for milk!

Every product (crops, milk, and moo moos) can be sold for a base rate, but if
someone's asking for a specific product (e.g. a specific breed of moo moo at
a specific min weight), you get a commission bonus.

Most interactions occur by picking up objects and bumping them into other
objects. For example, a bag of 10 carrots seeds being placed onto an empty
garden plot will plant a carrot in the plot, removing one seed from the bag.

You can purchase a gate key which allows you to unlock more land. Up a flight
of wooden stairs beside a short cliff-face is a big wooden platform with plenty
of places to farm, all right beside the sell-box! Wooden boards inlaid into the
dirt?

TODO: simple starting-area map. slightly uneven terrain, a house, walls surrounding
it all (bar a closed gate you can't really see through) and paths (slightly raised
mesh of a repeating path texture with transparent edges so it's not part of the
ground itself). no need to make beyond this for now

3 mesh system: 1 visible, 1 collision, 1 grass placement

add onion and potato and that's probably good enough for the demo
