# New Hand in Mootown

[Itch.io page](https://dairycultist.itch.io/new-hand-in-mootown)

In order to combat depression, I'm making a game that's fun (and imperfect).
The game should come out at some point, OK? So manage the scope, OK?

## Notes

The moo moos run the shops. they are just 2D textures like paper mario, instead
of full, cumbersome, 3D models.

Inspired by Slime Rancher, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, etc.

Farming game, with low poly cowgals, crops, customization, and cozy vibe.

World is pre-hand-crafted with pre-determined regions for garden plots and stuff.

Tiny game about farming in Mootown. Moo moos live in houses all around, whom
you can talk to and help out like Animal Crossing (if you can find where their
houses are!).

**Moo moo requests:**
sell crops at the attending shopkeep, or buy seeds from her crate. selling crops
the shopkeep is requesting (so she can eat them) gives double price, and reaching
the request goal comes with a gift (usually bottles of their own milk). this
encourages farming crops that may not otherwise be economically viable. performing
these requests makes the moo moos visually chonkier and improves your friendship
with the moo moo (as evident in new dialogue).

dialogue system

Most interactions occur by picking up objects and bumping them into other
objects. For example, a bag of 10 carrots seeds being placed onto an empty
garden plot will plant a carrot in the plot, removing one seed from the bag.

You can purchase a gate key which allows you to unlock more land. This either
is simply to get more farm plots, or unlock new regions with different terrain,
crops (via local shops), and moo moos.
Unlocking new areas lets you access more houses, and thus meet new moo moos.

TODO: simple starting-area map. slightly uneven terrain, a house, walls surrounding
it all (bar a closed gate you can't really see through) and paths (slightly raised
mesh of a repeating path texture with transparent edges so it's not part of the
ground itself). no need to make beyond this for now

3 mesh system: 1 visible, 1 collision, 1 grass placement

paths are gonna have a spritesheet texture (straight, end, T, idk)

add onion and potato and that's probably good enough for the demo
