# FunGame

In order to combat depression, I'm making a game that's fun (even if it's not perfect). It's a ranching/farming game, with low poly cowgals, crops, customization, and cozy animal crossing vibe.

world is pre-hand-crafted, like slime rancher, with pre-determined regions for garden plots and stuff

tiny game about ranching moo moos, and they have stats like weight and such, and
different breeds that sell for different amounts on the market (every cowgirl
can be sold for a base rate, but if someone's asking for a specific type at a
certain min weight, you get a commission bonus). you buy juvenile ones, raise
them to adolecense, then either sell them for profit or just keep em around.
AND you can also grow crops in a little garden area, which you can feed to the
gals

mechanic is picking stuff up. when something bumps into something else, an
interaction occurs. for example, a bag of 10 carrots seeds being placed onto
an empty garden plot will plant 1 seed in the plot, removing it from the bag.
