# FunGame

In order to combat depression, I'm making a game for the purpose of having fun, instead of making something "good."

the project im making for fun

bring big items to the shredder (a bit wall) where they initiate a script that draws them into it slowly while shaking and throwing out chips

chips are small pink~light blue (shader!) octahedron (if you throw them at the shredder they just tink off) which you then sell
