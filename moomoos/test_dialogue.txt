Oh, it's you! The new farmer!
Welcome to Mootown!
My name's Jess, I run this here farmer's market.
Lots of ladies around here open shops for farmers to make a bit of cash.
We haven't actually had a farmer around for a while...
So we're glad you arrived!
Say, you're a green thumb, right?
Could you do a girl a favour and grow some [Sugar Cherries]? They're my favourite!
Once you have the money of course.
I'll make sure to subsidize you for it!
And maybe give you a little extra in return...
Anywho, I look forward to seeing you around!
